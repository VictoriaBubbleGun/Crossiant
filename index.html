    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. <br />
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. <br />
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. <br />
      The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
